# Universal-Knowledge-Graph-based-Biomedical-Knowledge-Enlargment
## Introduction:
    
In order to support biomedical research on COVID-19 with information science, we are developing an AI system that automatically analyzes big data from 336K academic abstracts and 160 papers related to COVID-19 and other 30 million abstracts of biomedical papers. This system significantly augments the existing knowledge base by automatically extracting the vast amount of information and knowledge that may be relevant to COVID-19 from the big data. We also infer potential relationship among gene/protein, drug, disease , symptoms, enzyme, etc. based on the associations among the large mount of knowledge and reference relationships between papers. The system presents such information to researchers and supports access to academic papers, knowledge and a "big picture" that would contribute to the <b> academic </b> research on mechanism, drugs repurposing, diagnostics, etc.
