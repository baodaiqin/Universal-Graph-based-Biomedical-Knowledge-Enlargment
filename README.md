# Universal Knowledge Graph based Biomedical Knowledge Enlargment
## Introduction:
    
In order to support biomedical research on COVID-19 with information science, we are developing an AI system that automatically analyzes big data from 336K abstracts and 160K full papers related to COVID-19 and other 30 million abstracts of biomedical papers. This system significantly augments the existing knowledge base by automatically extracting the vast amount of information and knowledge that may be relevant to COVID-19 from the big data. We also infer potential relationship among gene/protein, drug, disease , symptoms, enzyme, etc. based on the associations among the large mount of knowledge and papers. The system extracts such information to researchers and supports access to academic papers, knowledge and a "big picture" that would contribute to the **academic** research on mechanism, drugs repurposing, diagnostics, etc.

## Extracted Biomedical Triples:

- The extracted biomedical triples are available [HERE](http://www.cl.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/~dq/Data_for_M_CREST/KB_data/), , as well as their corresponding reasoning evidences, where "predicted_triplets_with_evidences_1~3.json" contain COVID-19 related triples.
- The format of the dataset is as follows, where, 
    - "relation" is the predicted relationshop between "head" and "tail",
    - "score" represents the confidence score of our system on the prediction, 
    - "evidences" contain multiple multi-HOP reasoning paths, 
    - each path is annotated with its attention score "ATT",
    - each "HOP" represents a relationship between an entity pair (e.g., "COVID-19" and "D27_B_cells"), 
    - each entity is marked by its UMLS UCI (e.g., "D27_B_cells///C1824668") (we just manually create a UCI "C0000000" for "COVID-19"), 
    - HOPs are connected by an intermediate entity (e.g., "C1824668" is the intermediate entity connecting "HOP1" and "HOP2"),
    - "PMID" and "PCMID" are attached to each "HOP" for checking its source paper.

### An example:
Our system hypothesizes that "COVID-19 may_be_treated_by Chloroquine". The hypothesis is proposed based on multiple reasoning paths such as shown above. The hypothesis is recently shown to be promising by the [paper](https://www.kansensho.or.jp/uploads/files/topics/2019ncov/covid19_casereport_200519_2.pdf), which is published on [The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases](https://www.kansensho.or.jp/).

### Disclaimer:
The dataset is NOT for clinical usage! The dataset is ONLY for academic use, with no warranty or liability.

## Framework:

To identify biomedical concepts in textual corpus, we apply [Scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/), a state-of-the-art biomedical named entity recognizer, to detect UMLS entities in text. 

To predict potentially related candidate concepts and generate the supporting explanation (Reasoning Path), we, firstly, represent the large amount of knowledge extracted from existing structured knowledge base and unstructured text as a **Universal Knowledge Graph**. In the **Universal Knowledge Graph**, each node represents the UMLS concept and each edge indicates a UMLS relationship or a textual relationship, as shown in Figure3.

(Figure3)

Next, our system relies on a state-of-the-art Tail Prediction Model (Takahashi et al., 2018) that learns to project **Universal Knowledge Graph** into a same continuous vector space and predicts the candidate concepts based on the vector calculation. 

Then, our system searches the multi-hop reasoning paths that connect the candidate and target concept over the **Universal Knowledge Graph**. Finally, our system applies a new sate-of-the-art Relation Prediction Model (Dai et al., 2019, 2021) to classify (or reexamine) the relationship (a.k.a., relation classification) between target and candidate concepts based on the multiple multi-hop reasoning paths and evaluate the contribution and effectiveness of each path via an attention mechanism.

### Evaluate the performance of the relation classification:

    - numpy
    - sklearn
- Download the [Dataset](http://www.cl.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/~dq/Data_for_M_CREST/RE_data/origin_data.zip) and unzip it in the main directory.
- Then, run the following commands for preprocessing, or you can download the preprocessed dataset from here: [part1](http://www.cl.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/~dq/Data_for_M_CREST/RE_data/biomedical_part1.zip) and p[art2](http://www.cl.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/~dq/Data_for_M_CREST/RE_data/biomedical_part2.zip), and unzip their contents under `biomedical_part1` and `biomedical_part2` directory respectively.
